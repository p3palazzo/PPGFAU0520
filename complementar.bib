  abstract = {The recent critical discourse in the fields of philosophy, history, and literary criticism presents a disquieting challenge to many fundamental and historically pervasive hypotheses in the field of architecture. The premises in question include those concerning originality, imitation, signification, representation, and intention. The response to the current challenge from outside the field has been twofold within it. A number of architects, theoreticians, and critics have tried, for better or worse, to grapple with this challenge. Others discount their efforts either as an irrelevant fashionable exercise-a "new fad"-or, worse, as a "tortured or incomprehensible" exertion. What I examine here is the manner in which the field of architecture traditionally responds to external challenges to its presumed internal and autonomous concerns. This response, more often than not, takes the form of critical recourse to life, by analogy; that is, it draws parallels between buildings and animate objects by way of posing a critical distinction between a theory/praxis that is internally focused, hence original, meaningful, and productive, and one that is externally focused in space or time, hence, imitative, incomprehensible, and inherently destructive. Using the same "extrinsic" critical methodologies that instigate, in part, the current desire to redraw the line between the autonomous and the extraneous concerns in architecture, I point out, through a close analysis of John Ruskin's and Frank Lloyd Wright's recourse to the life analogy, the inherent paradoxes and contradictions that riddle the attempt to isolate, identify, and enumerate the signs of life in architecture. I take issue with the use of the life analogy as a critical and ultimately ideological tool for delimiting practice to a specific mode of design. I point out that the direct or the indirect use of the life analogy is related to a desire for control over signification and that the desire for life in architecture, by analogy or otherwise, bears the seeds of its dissatisfaction within and/as without.},

The futuristic Expressionist glass projects in both amorphous and crystalline arrangements can be seen as an expression of the utopian expectations for a new society after the German Revolution of 1918. Expressionist manifestoes and literature, on the other hand, reveal a thoroughgoing interest in a literary-architectural convention associated with glass and crystal, an iconographic theme that stretches from King Solomon, Jewish and Arabic legends, medieval stories of the Holy Grail, through the mystical Rosicrucian and Symbolist tradition down to Expressionism. Expressionist architects, familiar with the various earlier conventions, in a highly eclectic fashion reinterpreted the meaning of the glass-crystal symbolism as a metaphor of transformation to signify a changed society. This article, though it begins and ends with a discussion of Expressionist design, deals primarily with the sources and changes of this iconographic tradition.},

The openwork flyer is thus placed within a broadly conceived framework of theory and practice.},

And it is also suggested that this new vocabulary is specifically reflected in two passages about architecture, and in what J. A. Gotch called Jones' sentiments about architecture, written in the notebook now at Chatsworth. In addition, this article is concerned with the development of a more general vocabulary in England in the seventeenth century, for gentlemen and architects alike, that came from the tradition of praise, or epideixis, together with terms of a more particular kind to refer to the parts of architecture that came both from Italian and French.},

Norman Crowe seeks to overcome this division into the respective realms of specialists by recognizing the independence of both the natural and the man-made through an understanding of the often hidden roots of the world we contrive for ourselves. Crowe argues that we have lost a vital balance by neglecting our traditional motives for building in the first place. He argues for a symbiotic theory of man's making and nature's activity that views the built environment as a form of nature, one that nourishes the generative power as well as other enduring qualities of nature. In this sweeping view of architecture and urbanism across cultural boundaries, Crowe evaluates the connections between the natural and man-made in our towns and cities, farms and gardens, architecture and works of civil engineering. He draws on the lessons to be learned from the buildings and cities of the past in restoring critical traditional values that have been lost to modernism, which tends to see the built world almost exclusively through the abstractions of post-Enlightenment science.},

Despite his familial Protestantism-and later atheism-the collective spirit and universality he perceived in medieval Catholicism continued to attract the Swiss-French architect. In his later years this affinity informed two major masterpieces, the chapel of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp and the monastery of La Tourette near Lyon.},

Yet, as Professor Elliott points out, there has as a matter of historical fact been a revival of monumentality, and of the monument too, during the past two decades.

  abstract = {The Einstein Tower was the product of the complementary investigations of expressionism, reinforced concrete construction, and relativity undertaken by its architect, Erich Mendelsohn, between 1912 and 1920. The war-ravaged German economy of 1921, which impeded its construction, and the scientific agenda of its patron, Erwin Finlay Freundlich, which determined the character of its interior spaces, also helped shape its final appearance. Designed to serve scientific inquiry, it occupies a distinctive intellectual, as well as stylistic, position within the history of German expressionism. In this building Mendelsohn established the design approach that would characterize the rest of his German career, fusing attention to program with bold images of the thrilling instability of modern life. As its reception demonstrates, the functional aspects of the tower have been overshadowed by the degree to which its form has mistakenly been identified with a contemporary enthusiasm for mysticism, which in fact played no role in its design.},

  abstract = {The modern exposed frame started with the Chicago School and in the work of Mies van der Rohe it gained iconic significance. Facades had to be pure according to Modernist dogma, either exposed frame or bearing wall with punched windows. The mixing of the two was unacceptable. The Italian "transitionals", Muzio, Aschieri, Zanini, Lancia and Capponi are interesting to us because they do mix the two metaphors. Their facades can be read either as wall-plus-column or column-and-infill. This duality has a long history in Italy. It starts with the Romans and is revived during the Renaissance. The Baroque transforms the Renaissance applied orders into an abstract grid thus getting closer to the modern exposed frame. This article covers this metamorphosis of the facade and attempts to answer why architects applied the orders to their load-bearing exterior walls and how the Italian architects of the 1920s and 30s gave the applied columnar order a new structural reading. The grid during this transitional period became both an exposed frame and the trace of the Classical order.},

Scott's book is thus an important statement regarding the application of the formalist program in architectural history. In order to present the full implications of this program, Scott's views will be compared with the conception of art history exposed by Hans-Georg Gadamer in his "Truth and Method."},

  abstract = {Summary: Harmonic and Architectural Proportions in the 17th and 18th-Century French Theory. Architecture and music were often linked together. René Ouvrard, in his significant work concerning this subject, "Architecture harmonique, ou Application de la Doctrine des Proportions à l'Architecture" (Paris, 1679), attempts to prove (like Vitruv and later Alberti) that music works like architecture, both being based upon the same kind of fundamental proportions. These proportions are also proof of a divine harmony because as architecture, and music both follow human proportions, these arts are therefore imitative of the perfection given by God when He created the human form. The treatise of Ouvrard was also included in the "Cours d'architecture" of Blondel as part of the "Quarell of Ancients and Modernes"; the opposing view was represented by Perrault in "Parallèle". The theory of Ouvrard works with a rhetorical figure: the epephonical object. Using architecture in one way and music in the other way (it depends upon the first point of view), Ouvrard concludes that if these arts are to function in the same way, they must follow the principles edicted to them in Antiquity.},

It analyzes not only how architecture was translated into discursive forms so as to maintain its publicity within a spatially exploded, informational public sphere but also how the concreteness of architecture and real spatial experience was sometimes appropriated in order to render the abstractions consecrated by this public sphere—like public opinion and the general will—less nebulous.},
